Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

CIA World Factbook project
In this project, we use SQL to explore and analyze data from the CIA World Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/

The demographic information contained in this database:

population (as of 2015)
population_growth (the annual population growth rate as percentage)
area (the total land and water area)

Here are the descriptions for some of the columns in the facts dataset:

name - The name of the country.
area- The country's total area (both land and water).
area_land - The country's land area in square kilometers.
area_water - The country's waterarea in square kilometers.
population - The country's population.
population_growth- The country's population growth as a percentage.
birth_rate - The country's birth rate, or the number of births a year per 1,000 people.
death_rate - The country's death rate, or the number of death a year per 1,000 people.

This was a practice and play project to understand the basic SQL syntax and see how basic summary statistics can be done using SQL.

I will definitely explore more of it, but for a first run it seems very straight forward and easy to use.
